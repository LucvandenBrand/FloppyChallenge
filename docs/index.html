                <p>
                    When a colleague of mine asked if I would like to have a collection of his old 3.5" floppy disks, I <em>instantly</em> said yes.
                    Like most computer nerds, I'm inclined to be nostalgic about aging technology, so declining his offer was simply not an option.
                    This however lead to the logical dilemma:
                </p>
                <p class="centered">
                    <em>What am I to with all these floppies?</em>
                </p>

                <p>
                    After making a backup of all the data, the disks were just collecting dust in 
                    <a class="link" title="Click for a blurry picture!" href="./floppies_picture.jpg" target="_blank">a corner</a> of my office.
                    In order to make some use out of them, I created a challenge for myself:
                </p>

                <p class="centered">
                    <em>Fill all <span title="Yes, I counted. A few were broken, this is the number of working disks.">242</span> floppies with your own software.</em>
                </p>

                <p>
                    I am sharing my progress on my <a class="link" href="https://lucvandenbrand.com" target="_blank">Blog</a>, 
                    where I'll try to explain how every floppy has been filled for those who might be interested. 
                    If you wish to share some thoughts about this challenge, please do not hesitate
                    to contact me on my <a class="link" href="https://twitter.com/lucvandenbrand" target="_blank">Twitter</a>. 
                    I would love to hear from you! All source code, including this website, can be found on

                <p>Below you will find the complete list of filled floppies (<span class="completion">3/242 complete</span>):</p>

                            CHIP-8 is an old-school virtual computer designed to allow for developing cross-platform videogames. 
                            At this it has succeeded, as CHIP-8 has become the defacto platform for aspiring emulator-devs to cut their teeth with.
                            This very simple emulator allows you to play its games on your modern computer (using a 3.5" floppy drive).

                            Do you think of yourself as brave? Strong? Fearless? More importantly.... are you ready for the scare of a lifetime? HA!
