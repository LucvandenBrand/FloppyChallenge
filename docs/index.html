                <h1>Luc's Floppy Challenge</h1>
                <p>
                    When a colleague of mine asked if I would like to have a collection of his old 3.5" floppy disks, I <em>instantly</em> said yes.
                    Like most computer nerds, I'm inclined to be nostalgic about aging technology, so declining his offer was simply not an option.
                    This however lead to the logical dilemma:
                </p>
                <p class="centered">
                    <em>What am I to with all these floppies?</em>
                </p>

                <p>
                    After making a backup of all the data, the disks were just collecting dust in a corner of my office.
                    In order to make some use out of them, I created a challenge for myself:
                </p>

                <p class="centered">
                    <em>Fill all 100 floppies with your own software.</em>
                </p>

                <p>
                    I am sharing my progress on my <a class="link" href="https://lucvandenbrand.com" target="_blank">Blog</a>, 
                    where I'll try to explain how every floppy has been filled for those who might be interested. 
                    If you which to share some thoughts about this challenge, please do not hesitate
                    to contact me on my <a class="link" href="https://twitter.com/lucvandenbrand" target="_blank">Twitter</a>.
