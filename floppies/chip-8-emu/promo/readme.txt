Dear reader,

You are now the proud owner of your own CHIP-8 emulator! This little piece of software allows you to play CHIP-8 games on your computer, cool right?

What this floppy should contain:
1. chip-8-emu : This is the emulator itself.
2. roms : These are some free roms to try on your emulator!

All else is just additional data to help chip-8-emu do its job.

How to play a game you ask? Open your terminal in the same folder as the executable and call: 

chip-8-emu path/to/rom/file

Where "path/to/rom/file" is the path to your rom file. Easy right?

Have fun! :)
