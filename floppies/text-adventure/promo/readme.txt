Dear reader,

Do you think of yourself as brave? Strong? Fearless? More importantly.... are you ready for the scare of a lifetime? HA!
Then you're ready to play Text-Adventure, the interactive experience that will leave you trembling at your keyboard.
I hope you have a second pair of underpants at the ready.

What this floppy should contain:
1. text-adventure : This is the game, run this executable from your terminal to play the game.
2. game_data : This folder contains the game data, feel free to mod!

Thus, in short, run 'text-adventure' from the same directory it is stored in.

Have fun! :)
