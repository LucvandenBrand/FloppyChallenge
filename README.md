# Luc's Floppy Challenge
This is a repository containing all sources related to the Floppy Challenge I set for myself. You can read about it on [the related site.](https://floppychallenge.com)

## Development
Build instructions are provided with all floppy projects within `floppies`. This folder contains a useful Python script named `create_new_floppy.py`. You can use this script to quickly create new floppy projects: you can use the `-h` option to get more information from this utility.
